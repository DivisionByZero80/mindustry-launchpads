# Serpulo Launchpad Hub

mindustry mod

## Features

- open list of exporting sectors from planet view
- redirect single launchpad from list
- redirect all sectors at once

## Known Issues

- Redirecting Launchpads with no loaded Sector returns game to menu screen, redirect is saved though
- a loaded sector can't be selected as destination as the game ignores the info updates in that case, looking for a workaround

## Credits
